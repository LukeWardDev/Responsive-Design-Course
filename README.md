This project was completed using the design course [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXLjWRteuWI&t=1057s).

I already had a basic knowledge of HTML & CSS from following the courses by [The Net Ninja](https://netninja.dev/).

I wanted to solidify my knowledge of HTML & CSS by delving deeper into animations and responsive design.

This course also demonstrated the work flow of turning a design file, in this case a Figma design, into HTML and CSS.
